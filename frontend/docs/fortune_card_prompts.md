## 제작 팁

- **비율**: 3:4 세로 (Portrait)
- **테스트 순서**: 재물운 S등급(금룡보주) → D등급(파산풍파) 먼저 만들어서 밝기/분위기 차이 확인
- **일관성**: 공통 프리픽스 절대 변경하지 말 것. 개별 묘사 부분만 다르게.

# 운세 카드 시스템 구현 계획

## 1. 개요

운세 점수(0~100)에 따라 5단계 카드 이미지를 매핑하여 표시하는 시스템.
카테고리별(재물/애정/직장/건강) + 종합운 각 5장씩 총 25장 + 카드 뒷면 1장 = 26장.
기존 `DailyFortuneData` 모델의 점수를 기반으로 카드를 결정하며, 카드 수집(도감) 기능과 캘린더 일기 기능을 함께 제공한다.

---

## 2. 점수 → 카드 매핑 규칙

| 등급 | 점수 범위 | 파일 접미사 | 의미 |
|------|----------|-----------|------|
| 1 | 80 ~ 100 | `_1.png` | 최상 |
| 2 | 60 ~ 79 | `_2.png` | 양호 |
| 3 | 40 ~ 59 | `_3.png` | 보통 |
| 4 | 20 ~ 39 | `_4.png` | 주의 |
| 5 | 0 ~ 19 | `_5.png` | 위험 |

카테고리 키 매핑 (DB 키 → 이미지 파일 프리픽스):

| DB 카테고리 키 | 이미지 프리픽스 | 한글 |
|---------------|---------------|------|
| `wealth` | `money` | 재물운 |
| `love` | `love` | 애정운 |
| `work` | `work` | 직장운 |
| `health` | `health` | 건강운 |
| (overallScore) | `total` | 종합운 |

예시: 재물운 85점 → `money_1.png` (금룡보주)

---

## 3. 파일/디렉토리 구조

### 3-1. 이미지 에셋 (이미 배치 완료)

```
assets/images/card_img/
├── money_1.png ~ money_5.png
├── love_1.png ~ love_5.png
├── work_1.png ~ work_5.png
├── health_1.png ~ health_5.png
├── total_1.png ~ total_5.png
└── back.png
```

> pubspec.yaml에 `- assets/images/card_img/` 추가 필요

### 3-2. Flutter 코드 구조

```
lib/features/fortune_card/
├── data/
│   └── fortune_card_catalog.dart      # 카드 카탈로그 (26장 정보)
├── domain/

│       └── card_thumbnail.dart        # 도감용 썸네일
```

---

## 4. 핵심 모델 설계

### 4-1. FortuneCard 모델

```dart
class FortuneCard {
  final String id;            // 예: "money_1"
  final String category;      // money, love, work, health, total
  final int grade;            // 1(최상) ~ 5(위험)
  final String nameKorean;    // 금룡보주
  final String nameChinese;   // 金龍寶珠
  final String assetPath;     // assets/images/card_img/money_1.png
  final int scoreMin;         // 80
  final int scoreMax;         // 100
}
```

### 4-2. 카드 카탈로그 (정적 데이터)

```dart
class FortuneCardCatalog {
  static const List<FortuneCard> allCards = [...]; // 25장

  /// 점수로 카드 조회
  static FortuneCard getCard(String category, int score);

  /// 카테고리별 전체 카드
  static List<FortuneCard> getCardsByCategory(String category);
}
```

### 4-3. 점수→카드 매핑 함수

```dart
static int scoreToGrade(int score) {
  if (score >= 80) return 1;
  if (score >= 60) return 2;
  if (score >= 40) return 3;
  if (score >= 20) return 4;
  return 5;
}

static String getAssetPath(String category, int score) {
  final prefix = _categoryToPrefix(category); // wealth → money
  final grade = scoreToGrade(score);
  return 'assets/images/card_img/${prefix}_$grade.png';
}
```

---

## 5. UI 적용 위치

### 5-1. 카테고리 운세 상세 화면 (category_fortune_detail_screen.dart)

기존 점수 카드 영역 상단에 타로 카드 이미지 추가.
카드 뒤집기 애니메이션으로 카드 뒷면 → 앞면 전환 연출.

```

### 5-2. 일일 운세 상세 화면 (daily_fortune_detail_screen.dart)

종합운 카드를 상단 히어로 영역에 표시.
4개 카테고리 카드를 가로 스크롤 또는 2×2 그리드로 미니 카드 표시.

```
┌─────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────┘
```

### 5-3. 메뉴 화면 (fortune_summary_card.dart)

기존 FortuneSummaryCard에 종합운 카드 이미지를 배경 또는 좌측에 작게 표시.

---

## 6. 카드 뒤집기 애니메이션

`AnimationController` + `Transform`으로 3D 플립 효과 구현.

```dart
class CardFlipWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  final String frontAsset;  // 카드 앞면 이미지 경로
  final String backAsset;   // assets/images/card_img/back.png
  final VoidCallback? onFlipComplete;
}
```

동작 흐름:
1. 화면 진입 시 카드 뒷면(back.png) 표시
2. 탭 또는 자동으로 0.8초간 Y축 회전 애니메이션
3. 90도 시점에서 앞면 이미지로 교체
4. 180도까지 회전하여 앞면 완전 표시
5. 카드 이름(한글+한자) 페이드인

---

## 7. 카드 수집 (도감) 시스템

### 7-1. 개념

유저가 매일 운세를 확인할 때마다 해당 날짜에 받은 카드 5장(4카테고리 + 종합)이 자동 기록된다.
도감 화면에서 지금까지 수집한 고유 카드 종류를 확인할 수 있다.
총 25종 중 몇 종을 모았는지 진행률 표시.

### 7-2. DB 테이블: user_card_collection

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_card_collection (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) NOT NULL,
  profile_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) NOT NULL,
  card_id TEXT NOT NULL,           -- 예: "money_1"
  first_collected_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  collect_count INT DEFAULT 1,     -- 누적 횟수
  last_collected_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(profile_id, card_id)
);
```

### 7-3. 수집 로직

운세 데이터 로드 시(DailyFortuneProvider), 카드 5장을 결정하고 DB에 upsert:
- 새로운 카드 → INSERT (first_collected_at 기록)
- 기존 카드 → UPDATE (collect_count +1, last_collected_at 갱신)

### 7-4. 도감 화면 (card_collection_screen.dart)

- 수집한 카드: 컬러 이미지 표시 + 카드 이름
- 미수집 카드: 흐리게 처리 + `??` 또는 카드 뒷면 표시
- 카드 탭 → 확대 팝업 (카드 이름, 한자, 최초 수집일, 누적 횟수)
- 카테고리 완성 시 특별 표시

### 7-5. 라우트 추가

```dart
// routes.dart
static const String cardCollection = '/fortune/collection';

// app_router.dart
GoRoute(
  path: Routes.cardCollection,
  name: 'cardCollection',
  builder: (context, state) => const CardCollectionScreen(),
),
```

## 8. 캘린더 + 일기 연동

### 8-1. 개념

기존 캘린더에서 운세가 있는 날짜를 탭하면, 그날의 카드 5장과 함께 짧은 일기/메모를 작성할 수 있다.
운세 결과를 돌아보며 실제로 어땠는지 기록하는 용도.

### 8-2. DB 테이블: user_diary

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_diary (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) NOT NULL,
  profile_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) NOT NULL,
  target_date DATE NOT NULL,
  content TEXT,                    -- 일기 내용 (최대 500자)
  mood INT,                        -- 기분 점수 1~5 (선택)
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(profile_id, target_date)
);
```

### 8-3. 캘린더 화면 확장

기존 캘린더에서 운세 날짜 탭 시 바텀시트 표시:

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  2026년 1월 29일 운세 기록     │
├──────────────────────────────┤
│  [종합] [재물] [애정] [직장] [건강] │
│  카드5장 가로 스크롤            │
├──────────────────────────────┤
│  오늘 하루 어떠셨나요?          │
│  ┌────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ 일기 입력란              │  │
│  │                        │  │
│  └────────────────────────┘  │
│  기분: 😄 😊 😐 😔 😢       │
│                [저장]        │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

### 8-4. 마커 확장

캘린더 날짜 마커에 일기 작성 여부도 함께 표시:
- 운세만 있는 날: 금색 점
- 운세 + 일기 있는 날: 금색 점 + 파란 점 (이중 마커)

## 9. 구현 순서 (우선순위)

### Phase 1: 카드 기본 표시
1. pubspec.yaml에 `assets/images/card_img/` 추가
2. `FortuneCard` 모델 + `FortuneCardCatalog` 정적 데이터 생성
3. 점수→카드 매핑 유틸 함수 작성
4. `FortuneCardWidget` (카드 뒤집기 애니메이션 포함) 구현
5. `category_fortune_detail_screen.dart`에 카드 이미지 통합
6. `daily_fortune_detail_screen.dart`에 종합운 + 미니카드 통합

### Phase 2: 카드 수집 (도감)
7. Supabase에 `user_card_collection` 테이블 생성
8. 카드 수집 로직 (운세 로드 시 자동 upsert)
9. `CardCollectionScreen` 도감 화면 구현
10. 라우트 등록 및 메뉴에서 진입점 추가

### Phase 3: 캘린더 일기
11. Supabase에 `user_diary` 테이블 생성
12. 캘린더 날짜 탭 시 카드 + 일기 바텀시트 구현
13. 일기 CRUD Provider 작성
14. 캘린더 마커 확장 (일기 작성 여부 표시)
